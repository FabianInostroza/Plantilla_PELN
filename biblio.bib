  abstract={To build an Electrical Bioimpedance (EBI) spectrometer using the Impedance Measurement System-On-Chip AD5933 together with a 4-Electrode Analog Front End (4E-AFE) has been proven practicable. Such small measurement devices can make possible several new applications of EBI technology, especially when combined with functional textiles, which can enable wearable applications for personal health and home monitoring. After the implementation and functional validation of the 4E-AFE-enabled spectrometer, the next natural step is to validate for which EBI applications the 4E-AFE-enabled system is suitable. To test the applicability of this novel spectrometer on several EBI applications, 2R1C equivalent models have been experimentally obtained and impedance spectroscopy measurements have been performed with the system under study and with the SFB7 EBI spectrometer manufactured by ImpediMed. The 2R1C circuit parameters have been estimated with the BioImp software from the spectra obtained with both EBI spectrometers and the estimated values have been compared with the original values used in each circuit model implementation. The obtained results indicated that the 4E-AFE-enabled system cannot beat the performance of the SFB7 in accuracy but it performs better in preciseness. In any case the overall performance indicates that the 4E-AFE-enabled system can perform spectroscopy measurements in the frequency range from 5 to 100 kHz.}
